# Credit-management

Here 'credit transfer system' is the main folder to access all the web portal. To change database's username and password please follow these steps

There exists a file in credit transfer system directory named as conn.php which contains the main access configuration settings.

Replace our username and password with yours.

The file user.sql contains all the database.

To get it live you just need to import it in a database named as 'user';

Thanks
